# Concurrent Speakers Counter
Estimate the number of concurrent speakers from single channel mixtures to crack the "cocktail-party” problem. The project is based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which takes into account a past and future temporal context.<br>

## Model Summary









## Reference Paper & Code
As we all know, it is pretty hard to solve the cocktail-party problem. This is ***the ﬁrst study on data-driven speaker count estimation*** and the first step to crack the problem. Thanks for the author's paper and code and it helps me a lot.
